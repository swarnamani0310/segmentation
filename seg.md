## Structure of a Segment Table
The segment table is a vital data structure used in the segmentation process of memory management.
It stores information about each segment of a process, enabling the operating system to map logical addresses to physical memory locations efficiently.
Each process has its own segment table, which acts as a reference for the CPU to determine the starting location and size of each segment.
The segment table contains multiple entries, and each entry corresponds to a specific segment of the process.
Each entry in the segment table typically includes two primary fields:

**Base Address:** This field specifies the starting physical address of the segment in memory. It tells the CPU where the segment begins in the physical memory space.
**Limit:** This field defines the size or length of the segment. It ensures that memory access is restricted within the segment boundaries, preventing unauthorized access to adjacent memory locations.

When a program is executed, the segment table is loaded into memory and is accessible to the CPU. 
The table may also include additional metadata, such as access permissions (e.g., read, write, execute), segment status (e.g., valid or invalid), and other attributes that control segment behavior.
These additional fields enhance memory protection and allow for dynamic memory management.

The segment table ensures that each segment can be managed independently, which is critical for modularity and flexibility.
It supports processes with varying memory requirements and simplifies multitasking by isolating the memory of different processes. 
However, maintaining and accessing the segment table adds overhead, and its size increases with the number of segments in a process, which can impact system performance.

## Address Translation in Segmentation
Address translation in segmentation is the process of converting a logical address generated by a program into a corresponding physical address in memory. 
translation ensures that a program can operate within its logical address space while the operating system manages the complexities of mapping it to physical memory. 
The logical address in segmentation consists of two components: the segment number and the offset within the segment.

The translation process begins when the CPU generates a logical address during program execution. <br>
The segment number is used to index into the segment table, where the corresponding entry for that segment is located.<br>
The segment table entry contains the base address of the segment in physical memory and the limit of the segment.<br>
The CPU performs the following steps for translation:

*Segment Validation:* The CPU checks if the segment number is valid and within the range of the segment table entries. If not, a segmentation fault occurs.<br>
*Offset Validation:* The CPU verifies that the offset provided in the logical address does not exceed the segment's limit. If the offset is invalid, a segmentation fault is triggered.<br>
*Physical Address Calculation:* The CPU adds the base address of the segment to the offset to compute the physical address.
